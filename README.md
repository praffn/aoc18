# Advent of Code | C++

To compile just run `make`.

## Usage

```
aoc18 [-b] [-i filename] day
```

###Flags
* `-b` Toggles benchmarking. Final result will include running time
* `-i` Solutions will read given input file
* `day` An integer in the range 1-25

If no input file is given, the executable will default to reading stdin.

### Examples

* `aoc18 -bi inputs/input_3.txt 3`<br>
  will run day 3 with input file `inputs/input_3.txt`. will also run benchmarking.


* `aoc18 4 < inputs/input_4.txt`<br>
  will run 4 day from stdin (which is the contents of `inputs/input_4.txt`)
